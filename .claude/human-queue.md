# For a human

Everything the loop found but is not allowed to act on, plus everything it did that someone
should know about. Append only — the loop never edits or removes an entry, and never marks
one resolved. A human does that.

Format, newest last:

```
## <date> pass <n> <AMBER|RED> — <one line>

WHAT   what was found, or what was changed
RAN    the exact command
SAW    its output, trimmed to the part that matters
WHY    which envelope band and why it landed there
NEXT   the smallest thing a human could do about it
```

An entry is worth writing when it is specific enough to act on without rerunning the pass.
"Detector scores look off" is not an entry. "`untell-score` flags 19 of 20 human paragraphs
at the shipped threshold, command and output below" is.
